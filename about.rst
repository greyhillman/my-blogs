| **Infrequent:** I do not blog much.  
| **Passionate:**  I will commit a post if something really bugs me or I feel very passionate about a topic that is not otherwise covered by people smarted than me.
It will be about programming, most likely functional programming. 

| **About me:** Currently, I work as a Haskell Developer.  
| I have a long history of mainstream programming work, mostly using Java and friends (Groovy, JS, C#, ...). 
| My pet projects use Haskell and friends (Idris, Purescript, Elm, Scalaz, ...).
