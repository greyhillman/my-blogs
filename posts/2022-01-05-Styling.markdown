_[_add_blank_target git discussions](https://github.com/rpeszek/rpeszek.github.io/discussions/1)_


This blog has used a vanilla Hakyll styling with slightly modified standard pandoc CSS for code blocks.  
Some of the readers have experienced very weird font size irregularities, making it hard to read my blog.  

I did a full CSS reset using [_add_blank_target meyerweb reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css) and have restyled all posts.  _Sans-Serif_ fonts are now a hard-coded default (before the _font-family_ was not specified leaving it to the browser defaults to do whatever mischief they fancied).

Please let me know in git discussions if you still experience styling issues. 

Thank you to everyone who alerted me about the styling problems.
